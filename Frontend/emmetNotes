Emmet is a toolkit that allows the user to use shortcuts to create html and css code without the need to explicitly write down each of the tags needed.

Abbreviation syntax

While using Emmet the abbreviation will be the common language of use to work out the code that we need, it's similar to css selectors for describing elements positions.

---

Any word can be translated into a tag.

Nesting operators

With these we position abbreviation elements inside generated tree.

With > the elements will be inside each other for example div > p

<div>
  <p></p>
</div>

With the + the elements will be near each other on the same level, for example p + p + h1

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h1></h1>
